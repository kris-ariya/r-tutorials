There are two types of error a researcher can make when conductin a null hypothesis significance testing: Type I ($\alpha$) and Type II ($\beta$) errors. Type I error is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, $H_0$, when it is true. In other words, it is the false positive rate. Conventionally, type I error is set at $\alpha = .05$. Type II error is the probability of failing to detect a significant result, when $H_0$ is false; i.e., the false negative rate. Power is defined as $1-\beta$ or the probability of successfully detecting an effect, when $H_0$ is false.  

There are four parameters in power analysis. 

1. Sample size
2. Effect size
3. Alpha level
4. Power level

Knowing 3 of these 4, we can determine the remaining one. For example, we can conduct a priori power analysis to determine a sample size for a study with an effect size $d = .50$, power = .80, and alpha = .05. 

The current practice increasingly requires researchers to justify their sample size before conducting a study. This was done to encourage a better research practice as well as reducing wasteful resource in doing underpowered studies. 

We will look at two programs for power analysis G*Power and `pwr` package in R. 

# 1. G*Power

G*Power, developed by a group of researchers at Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, provides a user-friendly GUI for conducting power analysis. It covers wide range of statistical analysis, although some complicated design are still missing. You can download the program [here](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower).

1. Select the test family, e.g., *t* tests, *F* tests, $\chi^2$ test. For this example, we will do an independent *t* test. 
2. Select a specific statistical test. For example, *t* tests can be used in many sitations: between-subject design, within-subject design, one-sample test, testing slopes or intercepts for regression. In this case, we will use "Means: Difference between two independent means (two groups)" for an independent *t* test. 
3. Select a type of power analysis. We will choose "A priori: Compute required sample size"
4. Input relevant parameters
    i) Tail(s): Choose whether you use a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis. 
    ii) Effect size d: Cohen'*d*; hover the pointer above the box, it will show the conventional values. **4.1** The program can help you calculate *d* if you have information on *M* and *SD* for each group. 
    iii) $\alpha$ err prob: set alpha to .05
    iv) Power: set to .80
    v) Allocation ration N2/N1: If you will use balanced design (equal *n*), use 1. 
5. Click calculate
6. The required sample size will appear here. 


# 2. `pwr` package
```{r}
#install.packages("pwr")
library(pwr)
```

You can read more about the package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html). 

The `pwr` package provides functions for power analysis of many statistical tests. However, for more complex design, e.g., factorial or repeated-measure, we will need to use a diferent package. 

We will take a look at `pwr.t.test` function, which is used to analyze power for *t* tests with two-sample(equal *n*), one-sample, and paired *t* tests. 

The function takes multiple arguments: 

    pwr.t.test(n = NULL, 
    d = NULL, 
    sig.level = 0.05, 
    power = NULL, 
    type = c("two.sample", "one.sample", "paired"),
    alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"))

To determine `n`, you will leave it out and enter only `d` and `power`. You also need to specify `type` (of *t* test) and `alternative` (two-tail or one-tail tests). 

Following the same example. 

```{r}
pwr.t.test(d=.5, sig.level=.05, power = .8, type = "two.sample", alternative = "two.sided")
```

The n in the output tells us how many participants we need for each group. 

# Plotting a power graph
You can also plot the graph showing power level and sample size for a certain parameters. 

```{r}
medium_power <- pwr.t.test(d=.5, sig.level=.05, power = .8, type = "two.sample", alternative = "two.sided")
plot(medium_power)
```

# Other power functions
## One-way ANOVA
We can use `pwr.anova.test` to calculate required sample size for a particular effect size. We will need to specify `k` (number of groups), `f` (Cohen's *f*), and `power` (desired power level). 
```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.anova.test(k = 3, f = .25, power = .8) # An example of medium effect size with three conditions. 
```
